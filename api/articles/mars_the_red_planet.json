Because of its distinct red colour from Earth it is visible to the naked eye. Mars is the 4th planet from the sun. Mars is one of the <b>most explored planets</b> in Solar system. It is named after the roman god of war. Like earth it has days, seasons, and polar ice caps make it almost evident that it was active before. It is the only planet where we have sent rovers. One day in Mars is a little over 24 hours and one complete orbit around the sun takes 687 Earth days.","isQuoted":false,"gist":"","isGist":false,"isImage":false,"imageUrl":"","isMainHeading":false,"isCodeSection":false,"isSubHeading":false},{"html":"Surface condition","isQuoted":false,"gist":"","isGist":false,"isImage":false,"imageUrl":"","isMainHeading":true,"isCodeSection":false,"isSubHeading":false},{"html":"Mars has a very thin atmosphere, so it has many impact craters like the moon.
